# Master SIM Development

## Aim  
Develop a fully online Master SIM where changes can be made and deployed without relying on an external client (appyware).

**End date**: Planned to be fully deployed before the next workforce survey of 2025.  
**Pages**: Today's Workforce, Investment Plans, Future Workforce, Gap Analysis, Labour Supply, WASP.
**Calculations**: Economic and Social Value.

## Costs

Currently, the SIM costs around **Â£2,000 a month** for maintenance and development work. This can be drastically reduced as weâ€™re planning to move the work in-house.

- **Hosting costs**: Low, as weâ€™re planning on doing all the calculations ourselves, as opposed to what the SIM currently does where it calculates as you go.
- **GitHub Pages**: Free, but a custom domain name will cost around **Â£10 a month**.
- **Premium GitHub account**: Approximately **$21 a month** (not necessary at the moment).

Other than that, I currently canâ€™t see any additional costs.
